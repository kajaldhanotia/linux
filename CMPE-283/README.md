<h1>CMPE 283 Assignments for Spring 2021</h1>
<h3>By Sumeet Gupta and Kajal Dhanotia</h3>

<h2>Assignment 1</h2>

<h3>Kajal's Contribution:</h3>
Me along with Sumeet worked together to complete CMPE 283 Assignment. First, I created the GitHub repository and forked linux repository from torvalds:master. I then retrieved the .c file provided and began editing four remaining structs. I referred to the Intel SDM for doing this.

<h3>Sumeet's contribution:</h3>
I worked with Kajal for this assignment. On my machine, I retrieved the .c file edited by Kajal and added definitions for the different capability info regions. I also added four remaining rdmsr VM feature code. I also created a Ubuntu 20.04.3 VM on my laptop through VMWare Workstation. 

<h3>Steps we followed:</h3>
1. Retrieve the starter .c file and makefile from canvas.<br>
2. Add capability structs based on info from SDM and make calls to rdmsr and report_capability in the .c file
